![dtLAJJ.png](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/21/dtLAJJ.png)
## Prerequisite
- Python 3.8.x 64-bit
- numpy 1.18.5
- matplotlib 3.3.1
- scipy 1.4.1

Using other version may lead to unintended results

## Folders
- Data: test data and train data (MNIST).
- Model: NN model.
- Scripts: Python files to train and test the model.

## Usage
If you would like to train the model on your machine, You may first download the training dataset[https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv] and put it into *Data* folder. Otherwise, just run the main.py by `python main.py` to start the recognizer.


## Dataset

The dataset, which known as MNIST in csv, are obtained form https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/.
